# OpenSwarm Documentation: References

The OpenSwarm library leverages a number of online projects as dependencies, and does not claim ownership or authorship of any of them. Rather, they are included in the repository for the sake of convenience and version stability; it is known that the included versions integrate properly with OpenSwarm's codebase.

As creators of OpenSwarm, we express our most sincere gratitude and respect to those who developed each project. Without each of them, OpenSwarm would not have been possible.

For more information about and most recent versions of each dependency, visit the links below.
