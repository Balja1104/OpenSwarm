# OpenSwarm

OpenSwarm is an open-source library produced by the [D-CYPHER Lab](https://www.egr.msu.edu/d-cypher/) at Michigan State University to facilitate research in swarm robotics and human-robot interaction.

The library is implemented in Matlab and Arduino, and is designed to enable a central server to communicate with a swarm of bi-wheeled, Arduino-controlled robots via UDP broadcast.

For more information, browse the [documentation](Docs/00-Table-of-Contents.md) here!

Additions will be made to the codebase and documentation over the course of Fall 2019, so stay tuned for more.
