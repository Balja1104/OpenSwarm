# OpenSwarm

OpenSwarm is an open-source library written by Andrew McDonald at the [D-CYPHER Lab](https://www.egr.msu.edu/d-cypher/) at Michigan State University to facilitate research in swarm robotics and human-robot interaction.

The library is implemented in Matlab and Arduino, and enables a central server to track and communicate with a swarm of bi-wheeled, Arduino-controlled robots via UDP broadcast. To get a sense of what OpenSwarm's all about, browse the [documentation](Docs/00-Table-of-Contents.md) and [demos](Docs/05-Demos.md), and check out the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sg5UwmmTrKHravdvXssg3EsE5B3mb11p/preview) below!

Additions will be made to the codebase and documentation over the course of Fall 2019; stay tuned for more.
