# OpenSwarm
OpenSwarm is an open-source library produced by the [D-CYPHER Lab](https://www.egr.msu.edu/d-cypher/) at Michigan State University to facilitate research in swarm robotics and human-robot interaction.


The library is implemented in Matlab and Arduino, and is designed to enable a central server to communicate with and control a swarm of Arduino-powered robots using commands sent via UDP broadcast.


Additions will be made to the codebase and documentation over the course of Fall 2019, so stay tuned for more!
